# Requirements
## Introduction
Decibel Meter using Sound Module & Arduino with LCD Display has been designed specifically for detecting the level of sound produced from any source and its intensity as well. The LCD panel directly displays the information about the sound level in numbers. The sound is distinguished as low, medium, and high-level sound on the basis of number. LED by glowing gives the indication that noise is so high. The set up is absolutely self-contained and requires no other apparatus.

## Research
These devices are used in silent zones like hospitals, libraries, labs, and also in schools and colleges to maintain decorum. This helps us to maintain silence and also to identify noisy people so thatnecessary action can be against them.

## Features  

### Feature of System
1-Resistors: R1=100E, R2=1M, R3=330E.

2-Ceramic Capacitors: C1=C2=22pF.

3-Electrolytic Capacitors: 10uF/63v.

4-16 MHz Crystal Oscillator.



# SWOT ANALYSIS

#### Opportunities
- Can be implemented based on application type.

### Threats
- Other Similar Applications


 ## 4W's and 1'H
### Who
- Basically use for measuring noise level.
### What
- This helps us to maintain silence and also to identify noisy people so that necessary action can be against them.
### When 
- At the any time .
### Where
- At Hospital,School,Colleges.
### How
The Arduino Sound Module is detect the noise level.
